MySQL

Task 0 - First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

Task 1 - create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

Task 2 - In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

Task 3 - Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.
